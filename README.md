# # How to run
First of all it requires jQuery.
You can add it on 98 line in "trend.html"
98 ```html <script src="JS/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>```
Also it may require server: node.js or whatever you like and prefer
If you use node.js you can simply start server with __"node server.js"__
No syntactic sugar was used (sorry for that, guys! I think I need a time travel machine to learn SASS or LESS)
