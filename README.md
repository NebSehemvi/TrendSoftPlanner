# TrendSoftPlanner
# Demo-version of a planner
# It was made with TrendSoft' psd template
# All rights belongs to TrendSoft
# First of all it requires jQuery.
# You can add it on 98 line in "trend.html"
# 98 <script src="JS/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
# Also it may require server: node.js or Apache
# Or whatever you like and prefer
# No syntactic sugar was used (sorry for that, guys! I think I need a time travel machine to learn SASS or LESS)
